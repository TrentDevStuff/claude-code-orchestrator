notes: |
  Service enables rapid prototyping by providing local API access to Claude Code's
  1M context Sonnet model without additional API costs beyond Claude Code Max subscription.

  Key Features:
  - REST + WebSocket endpoints
  - Intelligent model routing (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
  - Token tracking and budget management
  - Parallel execution worker pool
  - Agent/skill discovery and integration (25 agents, 17+ skills)
  - Python client library + CLI tool (claude-api)
  - Agentic task execution (/v1/task endpoint)
  - Permission profiles and audit logging
  - Cost optimization
  - 228 tests, 80%+ coverage
